                "* Clear Instructions: We provided detailed guidelines on what to focus on and how to structure the output.\n",
                "* Output Formatting: We specified a JSON structure for the summary, ensuring consistent and easily parseable results.\n",
                "* Handling Edge Cases: We added criteria for identifying calls with insufficient data.\n",
                "* Examples: We included diverse examples to illustrate desired outputs for different scenarios.\n",
                "* Thinking Aloud: We asked Claude to show its analysis in <thinking> tags before providing the final JSON output.\n",
                "\n",
                "\n",
                "By employing these techniques, we created a robust prompt capable of generating structured summaries for a wide range of customer service call transcripts, while appropriately handling edge cases. This approach can be adapted to many other complex prompting scenarios beyond call summarization.\n",

                "\n",
                "**Important Note:** While we've developed a sophisticated prompt that appears to handle our test cases well, it's crucial to understand that this prompt is not yet production-ready. What we've created is a promising starting point, but it requires extensive testing and evaluation before it can be reliably used in a real-world setting. Our current eye-ball test evaluation has been based on a small set of examples. This is not representative of the diverse and often unpredictable nature of real customer service calls. To ensure the prompt's effectiveness and reliability, we need to implement a comprehensive evaluation process that includes quantitative metrics.  Robust, data-driven evaluations are the key to bridging the gap between a promising prototype and a reliable, production-grade solution."
